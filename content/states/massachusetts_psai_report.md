# Massachusetts Public Servant Appreciation Index

**Final Score:** 67.1/100  
**Tier:** Developing  
**Rank:** 2 of 5 states assessed  
**Assessment Period:** FY 2024-25

---

## Executive Summary

Massachusetts maintains a highly stable workforce with exceptional retention (91%) and 15-year average tenure, supported by comprehensive benefits and substantial technology investments ($946 per employee). The Commonwealth's cost-of-living-adjusted salaries compete well nationally despite base wages lagging private-sector levels. However, Massachusetts faces challenges with minimal published training budgets ($15 per employee), moderate public trust (42%), and limited recognition infrastructure. The state's workforce stability is its greatest asset, but investing more visibly in employee development and public recognition would strengthen appreciation.

---

## Key Findings

- **Exceptional workforce stability:** 91% retention rate with 15-year average tenure—the longest among assessed states
- **Substantial technology investment:** $946 per employee in IT modernization demonstrates commitment to modern tools and systems
- **Strong benefits package:** Defined-benefit pension with cost-of-living adjustments, 75-80% employer-paid health insurance, and generous leave
- **Minimal training budget transparency:** Only $15 per employee in published training expenditures—lowest among all assessed states
- **Limited recognition visibility:** No HOPS stories and sparse public recognition events despite some strong formal programs

---

## Dimension 1: Competitive Compensation

**Score:** 70.2/100

### What We Found

Massachusetts offers strong total compensation when benefits and cost-of-living adjustments are considered, though base salaries significantly lag private-sector comparisons. Public employees earn a median of $49,598 compared to $79,113 in the private sector (63% ratio). However, the Commonwealth's cost-of-living is 8% above national average, and when salaries are adjusted for purchasing power, they become competitive. Excellent benefits substantially enhance total compensation value.

### Strengths

- **Defined-benefit pension:** Employees vest after 10 years and receive cost-of-living adjustments on the first $13,000 of their pension annually
- **Generous health coverage:** State pays 75-80% of health insurance premiums, reducing out-of-pocket costs significantly
- **Comprehensive leave:** 10-25 vacation days (based on tenure), 15 sick days, and 3 personal days annually
- **Additional benefits:** Tuition remission for employees and spouses, wellness programs, employee assistance program, and transit subsidies

### Opportunities

- **Significant salary gap:** Public employees earn only 63% of private-sector wages before cost-of-living adjustments—the lowest ratio among assessed states
- **Targeted salary increases needed:** Focus on occupations with the largest gaps to improve recruitment and retention in competitive fields

---

## Dimension 2: Workforce Health

**Score:** 89.6/100

### What We Found

Massachusetts excels in workforce stability with the strongest performance among all assessed states. With only 9% annual turnover and employees staying an average of 15 years, the Commonwealth clearly retains its workforce effectively. However, moderate vacancies in healthcare (14%), social services (17%), and corrections (27%) indicate recruitment challenges in high-stress, high-need sectors.

### Strengths

- **Outstanding retention:** 91% retention rate demonstrates high employee satisfaction and effective workforce management
- **Longest average tenure:** 15-year average tenure shows employees build long-term careers rather than treating state employment as temporary
- **Low overall turnover:** Quarterly turnover rates consistently between 2.0-2.5% indicate workforce stability

### Opportunities

- **Mental health vacancies in corrections:** 27% vacancy rate in Department of Correction mental health positions creates operational strain
- **Social services gaps:** 17% vacancy rate for bachelor-level social workers may impact service delivery
- **Healthcare recruitment:** 14% median hospital vacancy rate suggests competitive pressure from private healthcare sector

---

## Dimension 3: Public Perception & Trust

**Score:** 34.3/100

### What We Found

Public trust in Massachusetts state government is moderate and varies by measure. Only 36% believe the state operates transparently, though other polls show 42-47% trust or approval. Recognition events are limited—primarily the annual Performance Recognition Program—with no evidence of recurring monthly or quarterly celebrations. The Commonwealth would benefit from more visible, frequent recognition of public servants.

### Strengths

- **Established Performance Recognition Program:** 41-year-old statewide ceremony celebrating 330+ employees annually with over 1,600 Certificates of Achievement
- **Multiple award categories:** Manuel Carballo Governor's Award, Governor Paul Cellucci Award, Eugene H. Rooney Jr. Award, and Commonwealth Equity in Governance Award recognize diverse forms of excellence
- **Multi-agency participation:** Large agencies participate in recognition activities

### Opportunities

- **Low transparency perception:** Only 36% of residents believe state government operates openly and transparently
- **Sparse recognition events:** Approximately 6 statewide annual events equals only 0.86 events per 10,000 employees
- **No monthly recognition programs:** Absence of recurring monthly or quarterly celebrations limits visibility of public servant contributions
- **Missing PSRW proclamation:** No gubernatorial proclamation for Public Service Recognition Week 2023-2025 found

---

## Dimension 4: Investment in People

**Score:** 44.8/100

### What We Found

Massachusetts demonstrates strong commitment to technology modernization and professional development access but severely underinvests in direct training expenditures—or at least fails to publicize such investments. With only $15 per employee in disclosed training budgets, the Commonwealth ranks last among assessed states in this metric. However, robust professional development programs and substantial IT investments partially offset this weakness.

### Strengths

- **Major technology modernization:** $165.5M investment in 2023-2027 capital plan for IT systems, including HR platforms and mobile workforce infrastructure ($946 per employee)
- **Comprehensive professional development portal:** MassAchieve offers thousands of free virtual courses accessible to all employees
- **Tuition remission program:** Extends to both employees and spouses, supporting degree completion and skill development
- **Statewide leadership programs:** Management Certificate and Supervisor Academy provide targeted leadership training

### Opportunities

- **Minimal published training budget:** Only $15 per employee across ~70,000 employees—lowest among all assessed states and likely understated
- **Budget transparency gap:** Actual training spending may be higher but is not consolidated or publicized in budget documents
- **Limited enrollment data:** Without tracking participation rates, the state cannot assess program effectiveness or identify gaps

---

## Dimension 5: Recognition Infrastructure

**Score:** 29.0/100

### What We Found

Massachusetts operates a well-established Performance Recognition Program with 41 years of history, but overall recognition infrastructure is underdeveloped. No HOPS stories document employee excellence, no evidence of length-of-service recognition programs exists, and Public Service Recognition Week lacks gubernatorial proclamations. The state has formal programs but limited visibility and frequency of recognition activities.

### Strengths

- **Long-standing awards program:** Performance Recognition Program has 41-year history and celebrates 330+ employees annually
- **Prestigious statewide awards:** Four major award categories recognize excellence, leadership, innovation, and equity contributions
- **Multi-agency reach:** Large agencies participate in annual recognition activities

### Opportunities

- **No HOPS stories:** Zero Massachusetts stories on Humans of Public Service platform means missed opportunities for positive public narratives
- **Missing length-of-service recognition:** No evidence of formal program recognizing employees at career milestones (5, 10, 15+ years)
- **No Public Service Recognition Week proclamation:** Governor has not issued PSRW proclamation in recent years, missing opportunity for statewide visibility
- **Limited event frequency:** Only annual events; no monthly or quarterly recognition programs to maintain year-round appreciation culture

## Overall Assessment

Massachusetts's overall PSAI score of 67.1/100 places it second among assessed states in the "Developing" tier, just behind Maryland. This performance reflects the Commonwealth's exceptional strength in workforce stability combined with notable weaknesses in training transparency and recognition infrastructure.

The state's greatest achievement is workforce health. A 91% retention rate and 15-year average tenure—the longest among all assessed states—demonstrate that employees who join Massachusetts state service tend to stay and build careers. This stability provides enormous value to citizens through deep institutional knowledge, experienced service delivery, and continuity in government operations. The comprehensive benefits package clearly contributes to this loyalty, with strong pensions, generous health coverage, and ample leave policies creating sustainable work environments.

Technology modernization investments at $946 per employee show the Commonwealth understands the importance of modern tools. This spending—primarily on HR systems and mobile workforce infrastructure—demonstrates commitment to employee productivity and satisfaction. Combined with professional development programs like MassAchieve and tuition remission, Massachusetts provides substantial resources for employee growth.

However, three significant gaps prevent Massachusetts from reaching higher performance. First, training budget transparency is severely lacking. At only $15 per employee in published expenditures, the Commonwealth either dramatically underinvests in training or—more likely—fails to consolidate and publicize its spending. Without clear budget data, it's impossible to hold agencies accountable or benchmark against peer states. Second, public trust is moderate at best, with only 36-42% of residents expressing confidence in state government. This perception gap suggests communication and transparency challenges that better engagement could address. Third, recognition infrastructure is underdeveloped despite the strong Performance Recognition Program foundation. The absence of HOPS stories, length-of-service awards, and Public Service Recognition Week proclamations signals missed opportunities to celebrate employees publicly.

Massachusetts's second-place ranking shouldn't obscure the reality that 67.1/100 indicates "developing appreciation"—solid but not exceptional. The state has built a foundation of workforce stability and benefits. To rise toward "Leading" performance, Massachusetts should focus on three priorities: publish comprehensive training budgets and expand program access beyond the current 80%, launch visible statewide recognition initiatives including HOPS story collection and monthly employee spotlights, and conduct regular public trust surveys with transparency-focused action plans.

---

## Next Steps

To improve its PSAI standing and move toward the "Leading" tier, Massachusetts should consider:

1. **Publish consolidated training budgets:** Require all agencies to report annual training expenditures and program participation rates. Consolidate these figures in the state budget to demonstrate investment levels and enable accountability.

2. **Expand formal recognition infrastructure:** Create a length-of-service recognition program honoring employees at career milestones. Issue annual Public Service Recognition Week proclamations with coordinated statewide activities.

3. **Launch HOPS story collection:** Identify and document 30+ compelling stories of Massachusetts public servants (approximately 4 per 10,000 employees) for the Humans of Public Service platform within the first year.

4. **Conduct transparency-focused trust surveys:** Commission annual polling specifically asking about government transparency, with results published and action plans developed to address identified concerns.

5. **Maintain technology investment leadership:** Continue substantial IT modernization spending, but better publicize how these investments improve employee productivity and work experience to demonstrate ongoing commitment.

## Methodology Notes

This assessment uses the Public Servant Appreciation Index (PSAI) framework version 2.2. Data sources include Bureau of Labor Statistics occupational wage statistics, quarterly turnover reports, National Association of State Personnel Executives tenure data, multiple public opinion polls (MassINC/WBUR, UMass/WCVB), state budget appropriations documents, capital plan IT investments, and Performance Recognition Program documentation.

**Data Quality Notes:**
- Salary competitiveness calculations use statewide median figures; specific occupational breakdowns were limited
- Training budget ($15/employee) represents only published line items in state appropriations; actual spending may be higher but is not consolidated
- Professional development access (80%) is estimated based on program descriptions; enrollment data not published
- Technology investment calculation assumes 40% of total IT capital spending benefits employees directly
- Recognition event counts based on publicly available program documentation; agency-level events may be underreported

**Assessment Period:** Fiscal Year 2024-25, with some data points from calendar year 2024-2025.

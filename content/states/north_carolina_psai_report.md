# North Carolina Public Servant Appreciation Index

**Final Score:** 61.7/100  
**Tier:** Developing  
**Rank:** 5 of 5 states assessed  
**Assessment Period:** FY 2024-25

---

## Executive Summary

North Carolina's strongest dimension is competitive compensation, with state employees earning slightly above private-sector levels (103%) and receiving solid benefits including a defined-benefit pension and comprehensive leave policies. Cost-of-living adjustments further strengthen purchasing power. However, the state struggles with data transparency across multiple dimensions: no published training budget, incomplete recognition event documentation, and limited recent polling on public trust (41% from 2022). High vacancy rates in healthcare (33%), corrections (26%), and social services (22%) signal workforce strain. North Carolina would benefit significantly from improved data collection and publication, expanded professional development programs, and visible statewide recognition initiatives.

## Dimension 1: Competitive Compensation

**Score:** 86.4/100

### What We Found

North Carolina provides competitive compensation with public employees earning slightly above private-sector levels. The median state salary of $58,960 represents 103% of comparable private-sector wages, and when adjusted for the state's below-average cost-of-living (94% of national average), purchasing power increases further. Benefits are strong, featuring a defined-benefit pension with a 1.82% multiplier, premium-shared health plans, and generous leave policies across multiple categories.

### Strengths

- **Above-parity salaries:** Public employees earn 3% more than private-sector counterparts in similar roles, reversing the typical public-private wage gap
- **Cost-of-living advantage:** With living costs 6% below national average, salary dollars stretch further than in peer states
- **Generous defined-benefit pension:** 1.82% benefit multiplier is among the highest, providing strong retirement security
- **Comprehensive leave policies:** Employees receive holidays, vacation, sick, community service, family illness, personal observance, and other leave categories
- **Multiple health plan options:** Standard and Plus PPO options allow employees to select coverage matching their needs

### Opportunities

- **Salary range compression:** Median competitive but ranges from $38,940 (transportation workers) to $115,070 (management), indicating potential compression in mid-level roles
- **Benefits transparency:** Exact employer-employee premium splits not published, making it difficult to assess true health coverage value

## Dimension 2: Workforce Health

**Score:** 81.9/100

### What We Found

North Carolina maintains moderate workforce health with 86% retention (13.7% turnover) and 12-year average tenure. However, the state faces significant vacancy pressures in critical sectors. Healthcare vacancies at 33%, corrections at 26%, and social services at 22% create severe operational challenges. First-year turnover of 33% suggests onboarding or early-career support problems. While teacher vacancies are low (5.9%), high-stress sectors struggle with recruitment and retention.

### Strengths

- **Solid retention rate:** 86% retention shows most employees stay with the state beyond the first year
- **Long average tenure:** 12-year average service length indicates employees build careers in state government
- **Low teacher vacancies:** 5.9% teacher vacancy rate in 2022 demonstrates successful education workforce management

### Opportunities

- **Healthcare crisis:** 33% vacancy rate in 2025 represents severe shortages affecting patient care quality and employee workload
- **Corrections staffing emergency:** 26% correctional officer vacancy rate in early 2025 creates safety risks and mandatory overtime burden
- **Social services gaps:** 22% frontline child-welfare vacancy rate as of December 2022 impacts vulnerable families
- **High first-year turnover:** 33% of new employees leave within first year, suggesting onboarding, training, or cultural challenges

## Dimension 3: Public Perception & Trust

**Score:** 28.7/100

### What We Found

Public trust in North Carolina state government is limited based on available data. A February 2022 High Point University poll found 41% of residents trust state government "just about always" (9%) or "most of the time" (32%). However, this data is now over three years old and predates the current assessment window. No statewide employee recognition events were confirmed despite search efforts, and the recognition events component received zero points due to incomplete data publication.

### Strengths

- **Moderate trust baseline:** 41% trust in 2022 poll provides starting benchmark, though not recent
- **Some local proclamations:** Evidence of local Public Service Recognition Week observances exists in some jurisdictions

### Opportunities

- **Outdated trust data:** February 2022 poll predates the 2023-25 assessment window by over a year; no recent state-specific measures found
- **Zero documented recognition events:** Extensive searching found no confirmed statewide monthly or annual employee recognition events
- **Missing PSRW infrastructure:** No comprehensive statewide Public Service Recognition Week coordination or visibility
- **Need for regular polling:** Establish annual or biennial trust surveys to track public sentiment and guide improvement efforts

---

## Dimension 4: Investment in People

**Score:** 26.0/100

### What We Found

North Carolina's investment in employee development is difficult to assess due to severely limited published data. No consolidated training budget exists in available documents, resulting in a zero score for that component. Professional development access appears moderate—the state offers leadership development, tuition reimbursement, and mentoring through the Office of State Human Resources—but participation data are unavailable. Technology modernization investments also lack transparency, with only moderate estimated spending.

### Strengths

- **Leadership development programs:** Office of State Human Resources provides leadership training for managers and supervisors
- **Tuition reimbursement available:** Employees can access tuition assistance for continuing education and degree programs
- **Mentoring programs:** Some agencies offer mentoring and professional development opportunities

### Opportunities

- **No published training budget:** After extensive searching, no itemized or consolidated training appropriation found—creates major accountability gap
- **Limited IT modernization transparency:** Technology investment data sparse; moderate spending estimated but not documented
- **Unknown participation rates:** Without tracking program enrollment, impossible to assess which employees benefit from development opportunities
- **Historical budget elimination:** Task force report notes training budgets "largely eliminated due to operating deficits," suggesting systematic underinvestment

---

## Dimension 5: Recognition Infrastructure

**Score:** 30.0/100

### What We Found

North Carolina's recognition infrastructure is limited by sparse documentation and visibility. The state offers multiple formal award programs including Governor's Awards for Excellence and innovation awards, and provides length-of-service recognitions. Governors typically issue Public Service Recognition Week proclamations. However, no HOPS stories exist for North Carolina, no comprehensive statewide recognition events were found, and programs are not prominently showcased to the public or employees.

### Strengths

- **Multiple award programs:** Governor's Awards for Excellence and agency innovation awards recognize outstanding performance
- **Length-of-service recognition:** Employees receive acknowledgment at career milestones
- **PSRW proclamations:** Governors issue Public Service Recognition Week proclamations, earning points for observances

### Opportunities

- **No HOPS stories:** Zero North Carolina stories on Humans of Public Service platform means missed opportunities for positive storytelling
- **Limited statewide event documentation:** No evidence of monthly or annual statewide recognition ceremonies or employee celebrations
- **Low program visibility:** Existing award programs not prominently featured on state websites or in public communications
- **Decentralized structure:** Recognition appears fragmented across agencies without coordinated statewide infrastructure

## Overall Assessment

North Carolina's overall PSAI score of 61.7/100 places it fifth among the five assessed states in the "Developing" tier. This ranking reflects a state that provides solid compensation but struggles with workforce challenges, data transparency, and public recognition infrastructure.

North Carolina's greatest strength is compensation. Employees earning 103% of private-sector wages—combined with strong pension benefits (1.82% multiplier) and comprehensive health coverage—create a competitive package. The state's cost-of-living advantage (94% of national average) amplifies this strength, giving employees more purchasing power than peers in expensive states. This foundation should position North Carolina as an employer of choice.

However, severe vacancy crises undermine this advantage. Healthcare vacancies at 33%, corrections at 26%, and social services at 22% indicate that compensation alone cannot solve recruitment and retention challenges. When one-quarter to one-third of positions remain unfilled, remaining employees face unsustainable workloads, burnout risks escalate, and service quality degrades. High first-year turnover (33%) suggests problems beyond compensation—perhaps inadequate onboarding, limited training, or cultural issues that drive new hires away.

Most concerning is North Carolina's data transparency deficit. The absence of published training budgets, incomplete recognition event documentation, and three-year-old trust polling make accurate assessment nearly impossible. This opacity prevents citizens from evaluating whether the state adequately invests in its workforce and holds agencies accountable. When training budgets were "largely eliminated due to operating deficits" (per task force reports), did that mean complete elimination or just reduced funding? Without data, we cannot know.

Recognition infrastructure is similarly underdeveloped. While formal award programs exist, they lack visibility and coordination. No HOPS stories celebrate North Carolina's public servants, no evidence of monthly recognition events emerged despite searches, and Public Service Recognition Week appears sporadically observed rather than systematically implemented. Employees may work hard and deliver excellent services, but if no one celebrates or documents their contributions, appreciation culture cannot flourish.

North Carolina's path forward requires confronting transparency challenges head-on. The state must publish comprehensive training budgets, document and publicize recognition programs, conduct regular public trust surveys, and address critical sector vacancies through targeted recruitment and improved working conditions. With competitive compensation already established, North Carolina has a foundation to build upon—but only if the state commits to transparency, investment visibility, and systematic employee appreciation.

## Next Steps

To improve its PSAI standing and move out of last place, North Carolina should consider:

1. **Establish comprehensive training budget transparency:** Require all agencies to report annual employee training and professional development expenditures. Consolidate and publish these figures in the state budget with per-employee calculations and program descriptions.

2. **Launch targeted recruitment for critical sectors:** Develop specialty hiring campaigns for healthcare, corrections, and social services with expedited processes, competitive bonuses, student loan repayment, and improved working conditions beyond compensation alone.

3. **Create visible statewide recognition infrastructure:** Establish monthly employee spotlights, annual awards ceremonies with significant publicity, and centralized coordination of Public Service Recognition Week activities across all agencies.

4. **Conduct regular public trust polling:** Commission annual surveys specifically asking North Carolinians about trust in state government, transparency perceptions, and public servant appreciation. Publish results with action plans addressing identified concerns.

5. **Publish participation metrics for development programs:** Track and report how many employees access leadership training, tuition reimbursement, and mentoring. Use data to identify underserved groups and expand program reach.

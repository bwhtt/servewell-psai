**Final Score:** 64.4/100  
**Tier:** Developing  
**Rank:** 4 of 5 states assessed  
**Assessment Period:** FY 2024-25

---

## Executive Summary

Virginia leads all assessed states in competitive compensation, with public employees earning 122% of private-sector wages and receiving excellent benefits including a hybrid pension with cost-of-living adjustments and 88-98% employer-paid health coverage. The Commonwealth also maintains strong formal recognition infrastructure with multiple award programs and official Public Service Week observances. However, critical workforce challenges—including severe vacancies in social services (30%) and corrections (27%)—combined with modest public trust (50%) and minimal published training investment hold Virginia back from higher performance. Addressing staffing crises in high-need sectors is essential.

## Dimension 1: Competitive Compensation

**Score:** 90.3/100

### What We Found

Virginia provides the most competitive compensation package among all assessed states. Public employees earn a median of $67,172 compared to private-sector median of $53,020—a 122% ratio that significantly exceeds parity. The Commonwealth's hybrid Virginia Retirement System offers defined-benefit components with cost-of-living adjustments, health insurance coverage is exceptionally generous (88-98% employer-paid), and paid leave grows substantially with tenure. Cost-of-living is nearly at national average, making strong salaries go even further.

### Strengths

- **Exceptional salary competitiveness:** Public employees earn 22% more than private-sector counterparts in comparable roles—highest ratio among assessed states
- **Generous health coverage:** COVA Care and COVA HealthAware plans cover 88-98% of premiums, minimizing employee out-of-pocket costs
- **Comprehensive leave policies:** Annual leave ranges from 12-27 days based on tenure, plus 64-80 hours sick leave and 32-40 hours family/personal leave
- **Hybrid pension with COLA:** Virginia Retirement System provides defined-benefit component with cost-of-living adjustments, vesting after five years
- **Additional benefits:** Tuition assistance, wellness programs, group life insurance, and deferred compensation options

### Opportunities

- **Hybrid vs. full pension trade-off:** Defined-benefit component is smaller than states with traditional pensions; delayed vesting (2-4 years) for defined-contribution portion may deter early-career employees
- **Wage compression monitoring needed:** High-paying professor ranks inflate employment-weighted averages; administrative and protective service roles may face compression

---

## Dimension 2: Workforce Health

**Score:** 79.8/100

### What We Found

Virginia maintains moderate workforce health with 86% retention and 10-year average tenure, but faces severe vacancy challenges in critical sectors. While teacher vacancies are low (3.4%), shortages in social services (30%), corrections (27%), and healthcare (15%) create significant operational strain. These gaps threaten service delivery quality and risk burning out remaining employees who must cover understaffed positions.

### Strengths

- **Moderate retention:** 86% retention rate (14.4% turnover) shows most employees stay with the Commonwealth
- **Solid average tenure:** 10-year average tenure indicates employees build mid-length careers in state service
- **Low teacher vacancies:** Only 3.4% teacher vacancy rate in August 2024, down from previous years, demonstrates successful education recruitment

### Opportunities

- **Social services crisis:** 30% vacancy rate for entry-level caseworkers at Department of Social Services severely impacts child welfare and family services
- **Corrections staffing emergency:** 27% correctional officer vacancy rate creates safety concerns and forces mandatory overtime
- **Healthcare worker shortages:** State hospital staff vacancies range 9-19% (median 15%), affecting mental health and medical service quality
- **Data granularity gap:** State publishes turnover rates but not separation counts, making it difficult to identify which departments drive turnover

---

## Dimension 3: Public Perception & Trust

**Score:** 38.6/100

### What We Found

Public perception of Virginia state government is moderate, with 50% of residents believing the Commonwealth is heading in the right direction. However, this "right direction" measure doesn't directly assess trust in state government operations. Recognition events are well-established, including Governor's Honor Awards and official Public Service Week observances, but documentation of frequency and reach is limited, resulting in low event-density scores.

### Strengths

- **Governor's Honor Awards:** High-profile ceremony celebrating individual and team excellence across state agencies
- **Formal Service Recognition Program:** Comprehensive infrastructure recognizing employees at career milestones
- **Official Public Service Week:** Governor issues annual proclamation with agency participation encouraged statewide
- **Moderate public sentiment:** 50% "right direction" response suggests balanced public opinion about state leadership

### Opportunities

- **Limited direct trust measures:** No recent polls specifically asking Virginians about trust in state government operations and services
- **Sparse event documentation:** Only 0.58 weighted events per 10,000 employees documented, likely understating actual recognition activities
- **Need for centralized reporting:** No statewide registry of recognition activities makes it difficult to assess true appreciation culture

---

## Dimension 4: Investment in People

**Score:** 23.3/100

### What We Found

Virginia's investment in employee development is difficult to assess due to lack of published data. While strong professional development programs exist—including Commonwealth Leadership Academy and tuition assistance—no consolidated training budget is available. Technology modernization spending appears modest at approximately $57 per employee based on available appropriations data. This dimension represents Virginia's weakest performance area.

### Strengths

- **Commonwealth Leadership Academy:** Intensive leadership training program for senior leaders with competitive selection process
- **Tuition reimbursement and educational leave:** Support employees pursuing degrees and professional certifications
- **Multiple development pathways:** Leadership institutes, management training, and educational assistance programs provide diverse growth opportunities

### Opportunities

- **No published training budget:** Despite extensive budget searches, no consolidated training expenditure figure exists—creating accountability gap
- **Limited IT modernization data:** Technology investments total approximately $15.6 million, with roughly half benefiting employees ($57 per employee)—far below $500 benchmark
- **Unclear program participation:** Without tracking enrollment and completion rates, impossible to assess return on investment or identify underserved employee groups
- **Need for transparency requirements:** Mandate agencies report annual training spending and participation metrics

---

## Dimension 5: Recognition Infrastructure

**Score:** 60.0/100

### What We Found

Virginia maintains robust formal recognition infrastructure with Service Recognition Programs honoring career milestones, Governor's Honor Awards celebrating excellence and innovation, and official Public Service Week proclamations. However, the Commonwealth lacks a flagship "Employee of the Year" program and has not yet contributed stories to the Humans of Public Service platform. These gaps limit public visibility of exemplary public servants.

### Strengths

- **Comprehensive Service Recognition Program:** Formal system rewarding employees at milestone anniversaries with ceremonies and awards
- **Governor's Honor Awards:** Prestigious recognition for innovation and courage, with individual and team categories emphasizing collaboration
- **Multi-agency Public Service Week:** Official gubernatorial proclamation each May with DHRM encouraging agency celebrations and events
- **Team recognition culture:** Honor Awards include team categories, promoting cross-agency collaboration and shared success

### Opportunities

- **No Employee of the Year award:** Lacks single flagship program that would spotlight exceptional individual performance and attract media attention
- **Missing HOPS stories:** Zero Virginia stories on Humans of Public Service platform means missed opportunities for positive public narratives
- **Limited event frequency data:** Recognition activities likely occur but aren't centrally documented, making appreciation culture difficult to measure

## Overall Assessment

Virginia's overall PSAI score of 64.4/100 places it fourth among the five assessed states in the "Developing" tier. This ranking reflects a paradox: the Commonwealth provides the best compensation in the nation but struggles with severe workforce shortages and limited transparency about employee investments.

Virginia's compensation leadership is undeniable. Public employees earn 122% of private-sector wages—the highest ratio among all states assessed—and receive benefits that rival or exceed any peer state. The hybrid pension with cost-of-living adjustments, near-universal health premium coverage (88-98% employer-paid), and generous leave policies create a compelling total compensation package. This strength should, in theory, make Virginia an employer of choice and drive low vacancy rates.

Instead, Virginia faces a workforce crisis. Social services vacancies at 30% and corrections vacancies at 27% indicate systemic problems beyond compensation. These aren't just numbers—they represent child welfare caseworkers who can't manage caseloads, correctional officers working dangerous mandatory overtime, and healthcare providers stretched beyond sustainable limits. When one-quarter to one-third of positions remain unfilled, remaining employees face burnout risks, service quality suffers, and the compensation advantage loses its power to retain staff.

The Commonwealth's recognition infrastructure provides a strong foundation. The Service Recognition Program, Governor's Honor Awards, and Public Service Week observances demonstrate institutional commitment to celebrating employees. However, Virginia scores poorly on public visibility metrics—limited documented recognition events, no HOPS stories, and no flagship Employee of the Year program that would capture media attention and public imagination.

Most concerning is Virginia's Investment in People performance (23.3/100)—the lowest dimension score among all assessed states. The absence of published training budget data isn't just an administrative oversight; it represents a fundamental transparency failure. Citizens and employees cannot assess whether the Commonwealth adequately invests in workforce development. Similarly, modest technology modernization spending ($57 per employee) suggests Virginia isn't keeping pace with the digital tools employees need to work efficiently.

Virginia's path forward is clear but challenging. The Commonwealth must solve its vacancy crisis through aggressive recruitment targeting high-shortage sectors, improved working conditions beyond compensation (adequate staffing, modern technology, career development), and systematic exit interview analysis to understand why people leave despite excellent pay. Simultaneously, Virginia should publish comprehensive training budgets, expand technology investments, and amplify recognition programs through HOPS story collection and centralized event coordination.

---

## Next Steps

To improve its PSAI standing and address critical workforce challenges, Virginia should consider:

1. **Launch targeted recruitment for critical sectors:** Develop specialty hiring campaigns for social services, corrections, and healthcare positions with expedited processes, hiring bonuses, and student loan repayment to address 25-30% vacancy rates.

2. **Publish consolidated training budgets:** Require all agencies to report annual employee training and development expenditures. Consolidate and publish these figures in the state budget with per-employee calculations to enable accountability and benchmarking.

3. **Expand technology modernization investment:** Increase employee-facing IT spending from $57 to at least $250 per employee, focusing on HR systems, case management platforms, and productivity tools that directly improve work efficiency.

4. **Create Employee of the Year program:** Launch a flagship statewide recognition program with significant publicity, nominating process across all agencies, and awards ceremony that attracts media coverage and public attention.

5. **Conduct comprehensive exit interviews:** Systematically interview all departing employees, analyze reasons for leaving by sector and agency, and publish annual reports with action plans to address identified retention barriers beyond compensation.

## Methodology Notes

This assessment uses the Public Servant Appreciation Index (PSAI) framework version 2.2. Data sources include Virginia's publicly available salary database (DataPoint), Department of Human Resources Management workforce reports, Roanoke College public opinion polls, agency vacancy data from legislative presentations, professional development program documentation, state budget appropriations, and recognition program materials.

**Data Quality Notes:**
- Salary competitiveness uses median occupational ratio method with Virginia DataPoint salary data
- Retention rate calculated from published 14.4% turnover figure for classified employees in FY 2024
- Vacancy rates compiled from sector-specific reports (education, healthcare, social services, corrections) with different reporting periods
- Training budget scored zero due to no consolidated expenditure figure found despite extensive budget document searches
- Technology modernization estimate ($57/employee) based on available appropriations, likely understates actual spending
- Professional development access (60%) estimated based on program descriptions without enrollment data
- Recognition event frequency (0.58 per 10,000 employees) based on documented statewide programs, likely understates actual activity

**Assessment Period:** Fiscal Year 2024-25, with some data points from calendar year 2024-2025.

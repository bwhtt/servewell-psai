# Maryland Public Servant Appreciation Index

**Final Score:** 67.9/100  
**Tier:** Developing  
**Rank:** 1 of 5 states assessed  
**Assessment Period:** FY 2024

---

## Executive Summary

Maryland demonstrates solid appreciation for its public servants, earning the highest score among the five states initially assessed. The state excels in workforce stability—employees stay an average of 12 years and turnover is low at 8%. Strong benefits including a defined-benefit pension, generous health coverage, and ample paid leave partially offset salaries that lag private-sector comparisons. However, limited training budgets, modest public trust (41%), and underdeveloped statewide recognition programs present opportunities for improvement.

---

## Key Findings

- **Strong workforce retention:** 92% retention rate with 12-year average tenure shows employees value state service
- **Excellent benefits package:** Defined-benefit pension with cost-of-living adjustments, 75%+ employer-paid health insurance, and generous leave policies
- **Salary competitiveness varies:** Public employees earn approximately 89% of private-sector wages, though cost-of-living adjustments improve purchasing power
- **Low training investment:** Limited published data on employee development spending, estimated at only $192 per employee annually
- **Recognition gaps:** While some strong agency programs exist, Maryland lacks visible statewide recognition infrastructure

---

## Dimension 1: Competitive Compensation

**Score:** 84.8/100

### What We Found

Maryland offers competitive total compensation when benefits and cost-of-living are factored in. While base salaries average 89% of private-sector equivalents, the state's comprehensive benefits package and modest cost-of-living adjustments result in strong overall compensation. State employees earn a median of $59,231, which adjusts to $56,953 in purchasing power—slightly above the national benchmark.

### Strengths

- **Defined-benefit pension:** Employees receive 1.5% of final salary multiplied by years of service, with cost-of-living adjustments protecting retirees from inflation
- **Generous health coverage:** The state subsidizes approximately 75% of medical and prescription premiums for employees
- **Exceptional paid leave:** Employees earn 10-25 annual leave days (based on tenure), 15 sick days, 6 personal days, and 11+ holidays per year
- **Additional perks:** Free transit passes in Baltimore region, tuition reimbursement, student loan forgiveness participation, flexible schedules, and telework options

### Opportunities

- **Salary gaps in key occupations:** Computer and mathematical occupations earn only 75% of private-sector wages; engineering and healthcare also lag significantly
- **Pension vesting timeline:** 10-year vesting period may deter early-career professionals compared to states with shorter requirements

---

## Dimension 2: Workforce Health

**Score:** 88.1/100

### What We Found

Maryland maintains one of the healthiest public workforces among assessed states. With only 8% annual turnover and employees staying an average of 12 years, the state demonstrates strong retention. Critical vacancies remain manageable across most sectors, though healthcare and corrections face elevated shortages.

### Strengths

- **Excellent retention:** 92% retention rate indicates satisfied employees and effective workforce management
- **Long-tenured employees:** Average 12-year tenure suggests employees build careers in state service rather than treating it as short-term employment
- **Low teacher vacancies:** Only 2.6% teacher vacancy rate, down 17% from the previous year

### Opportunities

- **Healthcare worker shortages:** 13% vacancy rate at the Department of Health signals recruitment and retention challenges
- **Correctional officer vacancies:** 11% vacancy rate may strain operations and employee morale
- **Social services gaps:** 10% vacancy rate in human services could impact program delivery

---

## Dimension 3: Public Perception & Trust

**Score:** 42.8/100

### What We Found

Public trust in Maryland state government is moderate, with 41% of citizens expressing consistent confidence—higher than federal government trust but indicating room for improvement. Recognition events exist but are decentralized and not highly visible to the public. The state would benefit from more coordinated, statewide celebration of public servants.

### Strengths

- **Agency-level recognition:** Maryland Department of Health hosts monthly Customer Service Spotlights and annual awards ceremonies
- **Teacher recognition:** Annual Teacher of the Year ceremony celebrates educators from all 24 school districts
- **Executive support:** Governor issues proclamations for State Employee Recognition Day and Transit Worker Appreciation Week

### Opportunities

- **Limited public trust:** Only 41% of Marylanders trust state government "most or all of the time," suggesting communication and transparency gaps
- **Fragmented recognition:** No single, highly visible statewide recognition program that captures public attention
- **Low event density:** Approximately 2.3 recognition events per 10,000 employees—below what would create a strong culture of appreciation

---

## Dimension 4: Investment in People

**Score:** 41.6/100

### What We Found

Maryland's investment in employee development is difficult to assess due to limited budget transparency. While strong technology modernization efforts demonstrate commitment to providing modern tools, training expenditures are not published, and professional development programs appear targeted primarily at managers rather than all employees.

### Strengths

- **Major technology investments:** Approximately $898 per employee in IT modernization, including new HR systems and enterprise platforms
- **Leadership development:** Maryland Certified Public Manager program offers 300 hours of nationally accredited leadership training at no cost to participants
- **Tuition support:** Employees with 12+ months of service can access tuition reimbursement for continuing education

### Opportunities

- **No published training budget:** The state does not disclose consolidated training expenditures, making it impossible to assess investment levels or hold agencies accountable
- **Limited program access:** Only an estimated 40% of employees have access to professional development programs, with most initiatives targeting supervisors
- **Unclear participation data:** Without tracking program enrollment, the state cannot evaluate return on investment or identify gaps

---

## Dimension 5: Recognition Infrastructure

**Score:** 42.5/100

### What We Found

Maryland has established several formal recognition programs but lacks a cohesive, highly visible statewide recognition infrastructure. Agency-level initiatives exist but aren't well-coordinated or publicized. The state has not yet contributed stories to the Humans of Public Service platform, missing an opportunity to celebrate exemplary employees publicly.

### Strengths

- **Length-of-service awards:** Employees receive recognition at career milestones (5, 10, 15+ years)
- **Multiple award categories:** Programs recognize customer service excellence, innovation, and outstanding performance
- **Department of Health leadership:** MDH operates comprehensive recognition infrastructure including annual ceremonies and monthly spotlights
- **Official observances:** Governor issues proclamations for Public Service Recognition Week and employee appreciation events

### Opportunities

- **No HOPS stories:** Zero Maryland stories on the Humans of Public Service platform means missed opportunities for positive storytelling
- **No statewide Employee of the Year:** Lack of a flagship recognition program that captures media attention and public imagination
- **Weak coordination:** Recognition efforts are fragmented across agencies without central visibility or branding

## Overall Assessment

Maryland's overall PSAI score of 67.9/100 places it in the "Developing" tier—the highest among the five initially assessed states. This performance reflects genuine strengths in workforce stability and benefits while revealing opportunities to enhance employee development and public recognition.

The state's greatest asset is its ability to retain employees. A 92% retention rate and 12-year average tenure indicate that people who join Maryland's public workforce tend to stay, build careers, and develop expertise. This stability benefits citizens through institutional knowledge and experienced service delivery. The comprehensive benefits package—featuring a defined-benefit pension, generous health coverage, and exceptional paid leave—clearly contributes to this loyalty.

However, three dimensions hold Maryland back from reaching the "Leading" tier. First, the state's training and professional development investments appear modest and are poorly documented. Without published training budgets or participation metrics, it's unclear whether Maryland adequately prepares employees for evolving job demands. Second, public trust at 41% suggests that citizens don't consistently see the value their state employees provide—a perception gap that better communication and transparency could address. Third, recognition infrastructure is fragmented; while individual agencies run strong programs, Maryland lacks the cohesive, visible statewide celebration of public service that would signal deep appreciation.

Maryland's position as the top scorer among assessed states shouldn't breed complacency. The 67.9 score indicates "developing appreciation"—solid but not exceptional. The state has established a foundation of competitive compensation and workforce health. Building on this foundation with enhanced training investments, strategic communication to boost public trust, and coordinated recognition programs could elevate Maryland to truly leading performance.

## Next Steps

To improve its PSAI standing and move toward the "Leading" tier, Maryland should consider:

1. **Publish comprehensive training budgets:** Require all agencies to report annual employee training expenditures and program participation rates. Transparency creates accountability and allows benchmarking against peer states.

2. **Expand professional development access:** Extend leadership and skill-building programs beyond supervisors to reach at least 60% of the workforce. Track enrollment and completion rates to measure impact.

3. **Launch a flagship statewide recognition program:** Create a "Maryland Public Servant of the Year" award with significant publicity, complemented by monthly employee spotlights on state websites and social media.

4. **Conduct regular public trust surveys:** Commission annual polling on citizen confidence in state government, with questions specific enough to guide improvement efforts and track progress over time.

5. **Contribute to Humans of Public Service:** Identify and document compelling stories of Maryland public servants making a difference. Target 25 stories (approximately 5 per 10,000 employees) within the first year.

## Methodology Notes

This assessment uses the Public Servant Appreciation Index (PSAI) framework version 2.2. Data sources include Bureau of Labor Statistics occupational wage statistics, Maryland Department of Budget and Management personnel reports and benefits documentation, university polling data (UMBC, Goucher College), agency recognition program documentation, and legislative budget analyses.

**Data Quality Notes:**
- Salary competitiveness calculations use BLS OEWS data that combines state, local, and federal government employment; figures are estimates rather than exact state-employee counts
- Employer health insurance premium contribution (75%) is estimated based on contractual employee subsidies; exact permanent employee rates are not published
- Training budget ($192/employee) is estimated in the absence of published consolidated training expenditures
- Professional development access (40%) is estimated due to lack of program participation data

**Assessment Period:** Fiscal Year 2024, with some data points from calendar year 2023-2024.

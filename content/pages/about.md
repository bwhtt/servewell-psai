# About ServeWell & the Public Servant Appreciation Index

---

## Why This Exists

I come from a family of public servants. Growing up, I saw firsthand the meaningful work that teachers, government employees, and nonprofit staff do for their communities. I wanted to follow that path.

But early in my career, I hit a wall. With student debt and rising housing costs, the entry-level roles in nonprofits and government administration simply weren't financially viable. The math didn't work. So despite my training as an engineer and my MBA, and despite genuinely wanting to serve, I ended up in the private sector—not because I didn't value public service, but because I couldn't afford it.

**That shouldn't be the choice people have to make.**

The Public Servant Appreciation Index exists because I believe we can do better. We can identify which states make public service sustainable—through competitive pay, comprehensive benefits, professional development, and genuine recognition. And once we know what works, other states can learn and adapt those approaches.

This isn't about shaming states with lower scores. It's about creating pathways for improvement and celebrating the places that are getting it right.

## Who I Am

My name is Brian, and I'm not an academic researcher. I'm an **engineer and MBA** by training, but more importantly, I'm an **innovator** who stays current with modern technology to execute ideas quickly and effectively.

I believe in using the best tools available—including AI collaboration—to build things that **inspire service** and **celebrate those who serve**. The PSAI is a project born from personal experience, executed with modern technology, and built with transparency at its core.

This work is part of **PBB Projects by br.ai.n**—my initiative to create tools and resources that support public service and civic infrastructure.

## How This Project Works: AI Collaboration

I built the PSAI using a collaborative approach with artificial intelligence, and I want to be transparent about how that works.

### The Division of Labor

**ChatGPT handles data collection:**
- Searches government databases, budget documents, and policy reports
- Extracts salary data, vacancy rates, benefits information, and program details
- Documents sources with exact URLs and access dates
- Follows strict search protocols (minimum time requirements, specific locations to check)

**Claude assists with analysis and refinement:**
- Reviews collected data for consistency and plausibility
- Helps structure findings into clear narratives
- Identifies patterns across states
- Refines framework methodology based on lessons learned
- Assists with writing reports and documentation

**I maintain human oversight:**
- Design the framework and methodology
- Review all data before it's finalized
- Make final decisions on scoring and interpretation
- Verify sources and flag questionable data
- Write recommendations and strategic guidance
- Ensure methodological consistency across all states

### Why AI Collaboration?

**Speed**: What would take weeks of manual research happens in days, allowing faster coverage of more states.

**Consistency**: AI follows the same protocols every time, reducing human error and subjective interpretation.

**Transparency**: All prompts, methodologies, and quality controls are documented and available on GitHub for anyone to review.

**Scalability**: As the index expands to all 50 states and eventually international coverage, AI collaboration makes comprehensive analysis feasible.

### The Limitations

AI can collect and structure data, but it can't:
- Judge what truly matters to public servants (that requires lived experience)
- Understand local political context that isn't in official documents
- Replace the insights that come from actual public servants telling their stories
- Make value judgments about what states "should" prioritize

That's why **your feedback matters**. If you're a public servant, policymaker, or researcher, your ground-truth knowledge improves this work.

## What I Hope This Accomplishes

**For States**: A clear picture of where they stand and concrete pathways to improve public servant appreciation.

**For Public Servants**: Visibility into which states value their work and validation that their concerns about compensation, development, and recognition are measurable and real.

**For Citizens**: Insight into how their state treats the people who serve their communities, and accountability for improvements.

**For Policymakers**: Evidence-based benchmarks for crafting legislation and budget priorities that support public workforces.

**For Researchers**: A transparent, replicable methodology that can be adapted and expanded.

Ultimately, I hope this index **moves the needle**—that it contributes to states paying public servants well, investing in their development, and celebrating their contributions. Public service shouldn't require financial sacrifice.

## This Is a Living Project

The PSAI is solid, but it's not finished. It improves through:

✅ **Testing across diverse states** – Each state analyzed reveals new edge cases and methodology refinements  
✅ **Community feedback** – Public servants, researchers, and policymakers identify gaps and suggest improvements  
✅ **Annual updates** – State scores will be refreshed yearly as policies and budgets change  
✅ **Expansion plans** – Coverage will grow to all 50 U.S. states, then internationally to identify global best practices

## I'm Looking for Collaborators

This started as a solo project, but **it doesn't have to stay that way.**

**I'm actively seeking collaborators who can contribute:**

**Researchers & Data Scientists**  
Help refine methodology, validate statistical approaches, identify new data sources

**Public Servants & Union Leaders**  
Share ground-truth experience, identify what the index misses, suggest improvements to dimensions

**Policy Advocates & Nonprofits**  
Use the index to support legislative efforts, build coalitions, amplify findings

**Developers & Designers**  
Help improve the website, create data visualizations, build interactive features

**State Government Contacts**  
Provide access to non-public data, clarify budget line items, validate vacancy calculations

**Writers & Storytellers**  
Help collect and share stories from the **Humans of Public Service** (HOPS) initiative

**If you're interested in contributing, [reach out through the contact form](#) or submit feedback via [GitHub](#).**

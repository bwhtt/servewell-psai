## Public Servant Appreciation Index

---

## Imagine a world where public service is celebrated.

Where teachers, nurses, firefighters, and government employees at every level are recognized as the vital contributors they are. Where communities invest in supporting their public servants. Where young people aspire to careers in service because they see it valued and appreciated.

**That world is possible. And some places are already building it.**

The Public Servant Appreciation Index reveals which states are leading the way—and how they're doing it. By measuring five key dimensions of support, we identify what's working: the policies, programs, and cultural shifts that make public service sustainable and meaningful.

---

## This isn't just about recognition. It's about creating pathways.

When we understand how top-performing states support their public workforce, other states can learn and adapt these approaches. The index becomes a roadmap for creating environments where service thrives.

**Our vision extends beyond borders.** While we're starting with U.S. states, the goal is global. By learning from countries excelling at public servant appreciation, we can identify innovations that transform how entire nations value service.

---

## The Challenge We're Addressing

Too many talented, passionate people want to serve their communities but can't afford to. Student debt, housing costs, and below-market salaries force difficult choices: pursue your calling or pay your bills.

**Public service shouldn't require financial sacrifice.**

The PSAI exists to identify which states make public service financially sustainable—and to inspire others to follow their lead. This is civic infrastructure for a service-oriented society.

## How It Works: Five Dimensions of Appreciation

The PSAI measures state support for public servants across five essential areas:

### 💰 Competitive Compensation (30%)
**Are public servants paid fairly?** We evaluate salary competitiveness, benefits quality, and whether cost of living makes public service financially viable. States that pay well and provide strong benefits score higher.

### 👥 Workforce Health (28%)
**Can states attract and keep talented people?** High vacancy rates and constant turnover signal problems. We measure retention, critical vacancies, and average tenure to assess workforce stability.

### 🤝 Public Perception & Trust (22%)
**Do citizens value public servants?** We track public trust in government and visible recognition infrastructure. States that celebrate employees publicly score higher.

### 📈 Investment in People (15%)
**Do states invest in employee growth?** Training budgets, professional development programs, and modern technology demonstrate commitment to workforce success.

### 🏆 Recognition Infrastructure (5%)
**Are there formal systems to celebrate excellence?** We evaluate award programs, length-of-service recognition, and official observances that create cultures of appreciation.

## What Makes This Different

### Transparent Methodology
Every formula, data source, and quality control procedure is documented and available for review on GitHub. We show our work.

### AI-Assisted, Human-Guided
ChatGPT handles data collection, Claude assists with analysis, but human oversight ensures accuracy and makes all final decisions. **[Learn about our AI collaboration →](#about)**

### Actionable Insights
Each state report includes concrete next steps—not vague recommendations but specific actions policymakers can take to improve.

### Continuous Improvement
The framework evolves based on real-world testing. We document every lesson learned and adjust methodology when needed. **[See how the framework evolved →](#framework)**

### Built by Someone Who Lived It
This isn't academic research—it's personal. Created by an engineer and MBA from a family of public servants who couldn't afford to pursue public service himself. **[Read the full story →](#about)**

## Moving the Needle

The goal isn't just to measure—it's to **inspire change**.

When states see where they stand and what works elsewhere, they can:
- Publish training budgets (transparency costs nothing)
- Expand recognition programs (modest investment, significant impact)
- Address critical vacancies (targeted recruitment for high-need sectors)
- Invest in professional development (build careers, not just jobs)
- Communicate value to citizens (boost trust through transparency)

**Public servants deserve fair pay, professional support, and genuine appreciation.** The PSAI helps identify pathways to make that happen.

## The Numbers Tell Part of the Story

**67.9** - Highest score among assessed states (Maryland)  
**61.7** - Lowest score among assessed states (North Carolina)  
**All 5** - States in "Developing" tier (50-74 points)  
**0** - States currently in "Leading" tier (75-100 points)

**The gap between current performance and true excellence is significant—and that's why this work matters.**

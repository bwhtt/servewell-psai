# State Reports

## How Well Does Your State Support Public Servants?

Each state report provides a comprehensive assessment of how that state values and supports its public workforce. These aren't rankings designed to shame or celebrate—they're diagnostic tools that identify strengths to build on and opportunities to improve.

## What You'll Find in Each Report

### Executive Summary
A quick overview of the state's performance, highlighting the most important findings. Read this first to understand the big picture before diving into details.

**Key elements**:
- Overall score and tier (Leading/Developing/Emerging)
- Rank among assessed states
- Top strengths and critical challenges
- Assessment period covered

---

### Key Findings
Five bullet points capturing the most important takeaways from the full analysis. These are the facts that matter most for understanding how this state treats its public servants.

**Example findings**:
- "Public employees earn 122% of private-sector wages—highest among all assessed states"
- "Critical vacancy crisis: 30% shortages in social services create operational strain"
- "Limited public trust: Only 35% of residents trust state government operations"

---

### Dimension-by-Dimension Analysis

Each of the five dimensions gets detailed treatment:

**1. What We Found**  
Summary of the state's performance on this dimension with specific data points

**2. Strengths**  
What the state is doing well—policies, programs, and practices worth celebrating or replicating

**3. Opportunities**  
Where the state falls short and what specific gaps exist

**For each dimension, you'll see**:
- The dimension score (0-100)
- Component breakdowns (how salary, benefits, and COL combined to create the compensation score)
- Supporting data with sources
- Context for interpretation

---

### Overall Assessment

A narrative synthesis that goes beyond the numbers:

**What the score means**: How the state's performance compares to the "Developing" or "Leading" tier expectations

**Why this score**: Which dimensions pull the state up or drag it down

**The bigger picture**: What patterns emerge when looking across all five dimensions together

**Path forward**: What it would take for this state to improve its standing

This section connects the quantitative scores to qualitative reality.

---

### Next Steps

Five concrete, actionable recommendations for improving the state's PSAI standing. These aren't vague ("invest in public servants") but specific ("Publish consolidated training budgets by requiring all agencies to report annual expenditures").

Recommendations target:
- Quick wins (transparency improvements, data publication)
- Medium-term reforms (expanding existing programs, launching new initiatives)
- Long-term investments (infrastructure, cultural change)

Policymakers, advocates, and union leaders can use these as starting points for legislative campaigns or budget negotiations.

### Methodology Notes

Transparency about how the assessment was conducted:

**Framework version used**: v2.2 (ensures comparability across states)

**Data sources**: Complete list with types of sources (BLS, state HR reports, polling data, etc.)

**Data quality notes**: Specific caveats about estimates, missing data, or methodological limitations

**Assessment period**: Which fiscal year or time period the data covers

This section allows you to evaluate the credibility of findings and understand confidence levels.

---

### Sources

Every data point in the report has a corresponding numbered source with:
- Full citation
- Direct URL to the source
- Date accessed

If you want to verify any finding, you can trace it back to the original authoritative source.

## How to Use These Reports

### If You're a Public Servant in This State

**Ask yourself**:

### If You're a State Policymaker or Agency Leader

**Ask yourself**:
- Which "Opportunities" can we address with current budget authority?

**Use the report to**:
- Identify ROI opportunities (modest investments that significantly improve scores)
- Benchmark against peer states
- Set measurable goals for workforce improvement
- Support budget requests with comparative data

---

### If You're a Researcher or Advocate

## Report Limitations

### What These Reports Show
- Quantifiable, comparable metrics across states
- Performance on compensation, workforce health, perception, investment, recognition
- How policies translate into measurable outcomes
- Where states excel and where they struggle

### What These Reports Don't Show
- Workplace culture or leadership quality (not quantifiable across states)
- Whether work feels meaningful or mission-driven
